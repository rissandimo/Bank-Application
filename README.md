This is a bank application using JavaFX. The user can create an account and make deposits and withdrawls to that account in an ATM style. 
This program allows the user to manage transactions - add and delete.
All the information gets saved to MySQL on the localhost. 

Libraries that I used:
JFoenix - This was used to get a rich and modern look the the application.
